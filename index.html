				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<hr>
				<img src="assets/images/ian-profile-img.jpg" alt="Ian Bowers on stage at SAK comedy lab" class="profile-image" />
				<p>My name is Ian Bowers. I'm a digital content marketing manager for an automotive dealership in Orlando, FL. When I'm not waist deep in content production, I'm usually playing video games, reading, learning new skills, doing improv comedy, flying my drone, or writing.</p>
				<br>
				<p>When it comes to gaming, I've been playing a lot of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> on PC competitively with a team of friends. I like reading books from influential people and have recently read <em>Zero To One</em> by Peter Thiel and currently working my way through <em>How To Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</em> by Scott Adams. I'm a graduate of SAK Comedy Lab's improv training program and conservatory. I'm starting to get into longform improv through Ad Lib Theater's training program. This is a sentence that doesn't start with <em>I</em> or <em>I'm</em>.</p>
